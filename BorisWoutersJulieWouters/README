How to run the problem generator (gen.jar)
--------------------------------------------

The generator expects an amount of problems to generate. This can be done
by giving as parameters "-nb" followed by a space and then the amount.
It is also possible to give a target value for the daily demand of employees, by
giving as parameters "-empl" followed by a space and then the target value.
If a target value is not given, the gerenator will create problems with a random
amount of employees (as explained in the report).

How to run the vns algorithm (vns.jar)
--------------------------------------------

The vns algorithm expects following parameters in the given order separated by spaces:
"g" or "c" for a general or cyclic problem,
the text-file that contains the problem to be solved (format explained below),
the value for the parameter kmax,
an output text-file that will contain the cost of the final solution.

An example of a command line to run vns.jar:
java -jar vns.jar c CDODOSPproblem1.txt 4 out.txt

The format of a GDODOSP
--------------------------------------------

A text-file containing a specific problem should contain following parameters,
separated by "-":
the timespan,
d^-,
d^+,
o^-,
o^+,
the employee demand array.
An example:
7-1-2-1-4-[12, 10, 11, 10, 10, 10, 11]

The format of a CDODOSP
--------------------------------------------
A text-file containing a specific problem should contain following parameters,
separated by "-":
the timespan,
the basic assignment,
the employee demand array.
An example:
7-[1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]-[15, 14, 13, 13, 14, 13, 14]
